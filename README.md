### Welcome to the ChatGPT-Powered PDF Assistant project repository by the DorkyDuos team.
This comprehensive project embarks on a project-based journey where we leverage Langchain and Streamlit to develop an interactive ChatGPT for your PDF documents. With the power of an LLM (Large Language Model) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, we will create an application that enables you to ask questions about PDFs and receive accurate answers.

## Introduction
In this project, we'll guide you through building a fully functional Streamlit application. Train GPT on PDF documents and fine-tune it to your specific use case. Experience the seamless user interface as you upload PDFs, ask questions, and receive prompt answers from the LLM.

## Abstract
Learn how to harness the power of Langchain, an open-source Python (and JavaScript) framework, to create intelligent applications. Discover Langchain's capabilities in training GPT models on your data and generating personalized LLMs. Explore text embeddings and their integration with Langchain using OpenAI's API.

## Features
- **Interactive PDF Assistant**: Ask questions about your PDF documents and receive accurate answers.
- **Leveraging Langchain**: Utilize Langchain's capabilities in training GPT models and generating personalized LLMs.
- **Streamlit Application**: A fully functional Streamlit application for seamless user experience.
- **Text Embeddings**: Integration with Langchain using OpenAI's API for text embeddings.
- **Task Automation**: Automate tasks and improve efficiency using Langchain with Streamlit.

## Tech Stack Used
- **Langchain**: For training GPT models and generating personalized LLMs.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **OpenAI's API**: For text embeddings and GPT capabilities.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.

## Solution
### Objective of the System
- **Real-time PDF Interaction**: Instantly answers questions about PDF content, enhancing document analysis.
- **Customizable Responses**: Fine-tune responses based on specific use cases and data.
- **Advanced Technologies**: Utilizes machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning to analyze PDF documents.

## Dataset
To ensure accuracy and effectiveness, we use a collection of PDF documents with varied content. This dataset enables the model to learn and respond accurately to different types of questions.

## Working
